Docs and media for the Grissom Lab website

This repo contains the .jemdoc files for the Grissom website (wgrissom.com and http://www.vuiis.vanderbilt.edu/~grissowa/). The site is based on the Mathjax-extended version of Jemdoc: https://github.com/wsshin/jemdoc_mathjax. 

Assuming you have jemdoc+mathjax installed and the jemdoc executable in your path, you can generate the .html files by running: "jemdoc -c myconf.conf *.jemdoc" from the directory containing all the .jemdocs.
