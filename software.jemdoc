Most of our shared code resides on my [https://bitbucket.org/wgrissom/ Bitbucket] or [https://github.com/wgrissom Github] accounts. Specific links are given below.

You will need Jeff Fessler's Medical Image Reconstruction
Toolbox in your path, in order to run a lot of this software. This can be
obtained from [http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/ his website.] Pulse design
codes may require [http://rsl.stanford.edu/research/software.html John Pauly's RF design tools.]

- [bsoptrf/ Optimized Bloch-Siegert Encoding Pulse Library:] From [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jmr.2012.11.004 this paper.]
These pulses are a dramatic improvement over conventional pulses (e.g. Fermi) used in Bloch-Siegert $|B_1^+|$ mapping,
due to their short duration (so you get a shorter TE and lower SAR for the same sensitivity),
and have a much wider operating bandwidth.
Two .zip files are in the linked directory,
containing pulses sampled on 6.4us and 10us grids.
We've also included phase difference-to-$|B_1^+|$ lookup tables and example MATLAB scripts and data to do the lookup.
- [nuslr.zip nuslr.zip:] Nonuniform and multidimensional Shinnar-Le Roux RF pulse design,
from [http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mrm.23269 this paper.]
Two examples are included: a spiral in-out refocusing pulse and a fat-suppressing spectral-spatial refocusing pulse for 3T.
MATLAB's Parallel Computing Toolbox is used to implement two CUDA kernels,
so you need that toolbox and a CUDA-enabled NVIDIA GPU to use the software.
- [optimalcontrol.zip optimalcontrol.zip:] Spin-domain
optimal control RF pulse design code. Based on the hard pulse
approximation. Included are multithreaded (pthreads) mex functions for bloch simulations and
derivative calculations.

Hopefully some will find this useful as a starting point for a more robust MATLAB-callable CUDA-based Bloch simulator.
