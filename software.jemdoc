Most of our shared code resides on my [https://bitbucket.org/wgrissom/ Bitbucket] or [https://github.com/wgrissom Github] accounts. Specific links are given below.

You will need Jeff Fessler's Medical Image Reconstruction
Toolbox in your path, in order to run a lot of this software. This can be
obtained from [http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/ his website.] Pulse design
codes may require [http://rsl.stanford.edu/research/software.html John Pauly's RF design tools.]

These pulses are a dramatic improvement over conventional pulses (e.g. Fermi) used in Bloch-Siegert $|B_1^+|$ mapping,
due to their short duration (so you get a shorter TE and lower SAR for the same sensitivity),
and have a much wider operating bandwidth.
Two .zip files are in the linked directory,
containing pulses sampled on 6.4us and 10us grids.
We've also included phase difference-to-$|B_1^+|$ lookup tables and example MATLAB scripts and data to do the lookup.
- [nuslr.zip nuslr.zip:] Nonuniform and multidimensional Shinnar-Le Roux RF pulse design,
from [http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mrm.23269 this paper.]
Two examples are included: a spiral in-out refocusing pulse and a fat-suppressing spectral-spatial refocusing pulse for 3T.
MATLAB's Parallel Computing Toolbox is used to implement two CUDA kernels,
so you need that toolbox and a CUDA-enabled NVIDIA GPU to use the software.
